# üéÉTePA

This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the paper [Test-Time Poisoning Attacks Against Test-Time Adaptation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08505), which is the first test-time poisoning attack against four mainstream test-time adaptation methods, including TTT, DUA, TENT, and RPL. Here is the workflow of TePA:
